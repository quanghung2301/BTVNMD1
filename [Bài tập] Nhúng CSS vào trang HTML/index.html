      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="internal-style">
      With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing
      between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what
      background images or background colors are to be used, different displays
      for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="external-style">
      <strong>Tip:</strong> The word <strong>cascading</strong> means that a
      style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements
      within the parent. So, if you set the color of the body text to "blue,"
      all headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will
      also get the same color (unless you specify something else)!
